# Transfer Joint: INR + BRL Under a Shared Funding Shock (63/126 BD)

**Family** T2-F3 · **as-of 2013-05-24** · targets `INR, BRL`
at horizons [63, 126] BD · unit `inr_per_usd; brl_per_usd` · split validation

**Target basis.** The target's own series is given only as an early window per asset (INR 1993-05-24..2003-05-23, BRL 1995-01-02..2003-05-23) plus its level on the as-of date (BRL = 2.0516, INR = 55.78, unit `inr_per_usd; brl_per_usd`). The decade in between is withheld deliberately: enough to see what kind of series this is, not enough to extrapolate where it has been heading. Do not difference across the gap, and do not read the early window as a width calibration -- these episodes are volatility regime breaks, which is what the corpus is for.

Inputs mounted read-only: `/input/panels/` (`g10_fx_daily.parquet`, rows only through the as-of date, and `em_transfer_early.parquet`, the target basis described above) and `/input/text/` (10 dated documents, all timestamps <= as-of;
see `text/corpus_index.json`).

Produce `forecast.parquet` with columns `[draw:int32, asset:string, horizon:int32,
value:float64]`, n_draws >= 200 (>= 500 recommended),
plus `forecast_meta.json`. `value` = level in the stated unit on the target date.
Every draw index must contain rows for ALL target assets (joint draw).

Scoring: S = 0.5 x marginal CRPS + 0.3 x joint variogram + 0.2 x tail penalty (lower
is better) against sealed realized outcomes.

**Text corpus role.** Transfer configuration: neither target has a recent path in any input panel — each carries only an early window and an as-of anchor (BRL = 2.0516, INR = 55.78). One Fed funding shock, two current-account-deficit currencies with different policy buffers — draws must correlate the two legs through the shared shock while sizing each vulnerability separately. Independent legs overstate distances; identical legs understate the differing intervention buffers.
