# MKT After a Bellwether Guidance Withdrawal (21 BD)

**Family** T2-F4 · **as-of 2020-02-19** · targets `MKT`
at horizons [21] BD · unit `cumulative_log_return` · split public-dev

Inputs mounted read-only: `/input/panels/factors_daily.parquet` (rows only through
the as-of date) and `/input/text/` (9 dated documents, all timestamps <= as-of;
see `text/corpus_index.json`).

Produce `forecast.parquet` with columns `[draw:int32, asset:string, horizon:int32,
value:float64]`, n_draws >= 200 (>= 500 recommended; >= 1000 for tail accuracy),
plus `forecast_meta.json`. `value` = cumulative log return over the h business days after the as-of date (sum of ln(1+r_t)).


Scoring: S = 0.5 x marginal CRPS + 0.3 x joint variogram + 0.2 x tail penalty (lower
is better) against sealed realized outcomes.

**Text corpus role.** As-of an equity high, set the day after a large bellwether company withdrew its revenue guidance over supply-chain disruption (8-K in corpus). The corporate disclosure sits against a calm tape, and contemporaneous texts flag an emerging external risk. Whether that risk propagates over the horizon is the open question; the tail must be sized from the documents rather than the panel's calm, and both the shock branch and the contained branch carry weight.
