# NOK Double-Shock Tail (21 BD)

**Family** T2-F4 · **as-of 2020-02-28** · targets `NOK`
at horizons [21] BD · unit `nok_per_usd` · split validation

Inputs mounted read-only: `/input/panels/g10_fx_daily.parquet` (rows only through
the as-of date) and `/input/text/` (10 dated documents, all timestamps <= as-of;
see `text/corpus_index.json`).

Produce `forecast.parquet` with columns `[draw:int32, asset:string, horizon:int32,
value:float64]`, n_draws >= 200 (>= 500 recommended; >= 1000 for tail accuracy),
plus `forecast_meta.json`. `value` = level in the stated unit on the target date.


Scoring: S = 0.5 x marginal CRPS + 0.3 x joint variogram + 0.2 x tail penalty (lower
is better) against sealed realized outcomes.

**Text corpus role.** As-of a risk-off week: virus texts have gone global while crude positioning (in-corpus table) is still constructive. The documents bear on the spreading virus and on crude positioning together, for the most oil-levered, least-liquid G10 currency.
