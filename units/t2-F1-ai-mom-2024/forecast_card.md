# Momentum Under AI-Theme Concentration (127 BD)

**Family** T2-F1 · **as-of 2024-05-31** · targets `MOM`
at horizons [127] BD · unit `cumulative_log_return` · split validation

Inputs mounted read-only: `/input/panels/factors_daily.parquet` (rows only through
the as-of date) and `/input/text/` (9 dated documents, all timestamps <= as-of;
see `text/corpus_index.json`).

Produce `forecast.parquet` with columns `[draw:int32, asset:string, horizon:int32,
value:float64]`, n_draws >= 200 (>= 500 recommended),
plus `forecast_meta.json`. `value` = cumulative log return over the h business days after the as-of date (sum of ln(1+r_t)).


Scoring: S = 0.5 x marginal CRPS + 0.3 x joint variogram + 0.2 x tail penalty (lower
is better) against sealed realized outcomes.

**Text corpus role.** Momentum is unusually concentrated in one theme, and central-bank texts increasingly reference AI investment. The documents bear on how crowded the factor is, and on how much width that crowding warrants over six months relative to the trailing panel.
