"""T2 scoring regression: golden fixtures in, pinned verdicts and composites out.

Modeled on track3's regression_suite. Motivation is recorded rather than implied: the CodaBench
driver's first-ever real T2 invocation (2026-08-16) crashed with KeyError 'card' and, patched,
produced a NaN leaderboard — defects that survived because nothing continuously scored a known
submission against a known unit. This suite is that something.

The sealed answer is committed under fixtures/<uid>/targets.parquet, out of the unit tree and
without an answer-shaped name, so the published repo carries no reference/ dir or realized*
file. Check 1 stages it back to reference/realized.parquet in a temp copy, so the real
_hydrate_ctx path is still what runs.

Checks, in order:
  0  no-answers     the committed tree contains no answer-shaped path (reference/, realized*,
                    outcome*) -- the firewall check the repo unit sweep (root=units/) misses
  1  golden-exact   minimal driver ctx {unit_dir, output_dir}, answer staged from fixtures/
                    -> gates all pass, composite == expected.json to 1e-9 (the golden parquet
                    is committed, so this is deterministic arithmetic; regenerating through
                    the CLI would couple the pin to numpy's RNG stream)
  2  public-smoke   committed unit has no reference/ -> admissible, score None, fixed reason
  3  g1-missing     forecast_rationale.md deleted        -> inadmissible, code no_output
  4  g1-empty       forecast_rationale.md whitespace     -> inadmissible, code schema_invalid
  5  g0-missing     forecast_meta.json deleted           -> inadmissible at g0
  6  cutoff         corpus doc dated after the as-of     -> the STAGING scan refuses it
  7  g3-thin        draws truncated below n_draws        -> inadmissible at g3
  8  cli-smoke      fresh CLI run on every pinned unit   -> gates pass (values not pinned)
  9  negative       the four measured exploits are refused: repeated asset, duplicate primary
                    key, extra grid cell, compression bomb
 10  redaction      no gate detail carries anything but an enum code and integer counts
 11  baseline-read  the published baselines read a unit panel, and read it CORRECTLY
                    (compared against the panel's own pre-as-of series, per asset)
 12  gap-guard      _diffs_without_gaps drops exactly the hole-spanning difference;
                    post-as-of rows are excluded; _extract_dates aligns with the series
 13  log-return     on reg-t2-logreturn (panel rows are decimal simple returns, target is the
                    cumulative log return at 21 and 127 BD) the CLI and the shipped baseline
                    both centre at h x mean(log1p(r)) -- anchored at exactly 0, not at the
                    last panel row -- with spread sd(log1p(r)) x sqrt(h), and agree with each
                    other; the CLI's history window is pinned to the 260 pre-as-of rows.
                    Pins the fix for public #2 (staging PR #14): before it, the CLI anchored
                    every card at the last observed row and differenced an already-differenced
                    series. The 127-BD horizon separates log1p from raw simple returns
                    (h x var/2 ~ 0.008 there vs ~0.0013 at 21 BD).

### Why checks 3, 4 and 6 changed shape at the 2026-08-22 freeze

3 and 4 used to assert that the refusal *text* named the file. It cannot any more: the public
detail is enum code plus integer counts only, precisely so no free-form string can carry a sealed
value. The refusals are unchanged; what they say to a participant is bounded, and the operator
reason still names the file on the operator path.

6 moved. Under the frozen worker/scoring topology the scoring program receives `input/ref` and
`input/res` and nothing else, so the participant mount -- where the text corpus lives -- is not in
its namespace. The corpus cutoff is enforced before publication, by `cutoff.scan_text_corpus_cutoff`
in the staging gate stack, and that is what check 6 now exercises. A check placed where its inputs
do not exist is a check that silently passes.

Exit 0 only if every check passes. After an INTENTIONAL scoring change, rebuild with
`build_reference.py --regen` and review the expected.json diff.
